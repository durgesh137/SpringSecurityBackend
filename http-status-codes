1. 401
{
  "status":401,
  "error":"Unauthorized",
  "message":"Unauthorized",
  "path":"/hello"
}
The HTTP 401 Unauthorized status code is a bit ambiguous.
Usually, it’s used to represent a failed authentication rather than authorization.
Developers use it in the design of the application for cases like missing or incorrect credentials.

=> 401 - for like missing or incorrect credentials.
2. 403
For a failed authorization, we’d probably use the 403 Forbidden status.
Generally, an HTTP 403 means that the server identified the caller of the request,
but they don’t have the needed privileges for the call that they are trying to make.

=> 403 - Forbidden status -> failed authentication
