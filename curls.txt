1. since spring-security is included therefore without authorization token it should not be accessible
curl http://localhost:8080/hello

curl response-
{"timestamp":"2024-03-02T15:26:11.815+0000",
"status":401,
"error":"Unauthorized",
"message":"Unauthorized","path":"/hello"}

2. here spring security requires user with default password in curl to access hello endpoint
curl -u user:116a9372-fecc-4488-bd3b-24606c6b6af2 http://localhost:8080/hello

curl response-
hello people!
