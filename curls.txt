1. since spring-security is included therefore without authorization token it should not be accessible
curl http://localhost:8080/hello

curl response-
{"timestamp":"2024-03-02T15:26:11.815+0000",
"status":401,
"error":"Unauthorized",
"message":"Unauthorized","path":"/hello"}

2. here spring security requires user with default password in curl to access hello endpoint
curl -u user:116a9372-fecc-4488-bd3b-24606c6b6af2 http://localhost:8080/hello

curl response-
hello people!

3. using basic authorization token in curl how actual requests are made-
3.1 create base64 representation
echo -n user:9c2c082d-a80e-46fd-9a1e-0cd5378b7b4a | base64
=>dXNlcjo5YzJjMDgyZC1hODBlLTQ2ZmQtOWExZS0wY2Q1Mzc4YjdiNGE=
=> here -n means no trailing new line should be added
=> above command in linux gives base64 data
=> online url https://www.base64encode.org/ also does the same

3.2 curl authorization header for basic authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjo5YzJjMDgyZC1hODBlLTQ2ZmQtOWExZS0wY2Q1Mzc4YjdiNGE="  localhost:8080/hello
